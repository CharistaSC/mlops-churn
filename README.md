# Customer Churn Prediction (MLOps Project)

This project is a machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn based on structured telco service data. It explores various ML models and covers key stages of the MLOps lifecycle, including preprocessing, training, evaluation, and (optionally) deployment via Docker.

## ⚙️ Models Explored

- ✅ XGBoost (`xgboost.XGBClassifier`)
- ✅ AdaBoost (`AdaBoostClassifier` with `DecisionTreeClassifier` base)
- ⏳ RandomForest (Initial baseline)
- 🔬 GridSearchCV used for hyperparameter tuning (ROC-AUC as metric)

---

## 🧪 Training Pipeline

1. **Preprocessing:**
   - One-hot encoding for categorical features
   - Binary conversion for Yes/No features
   - Handled mixed binary + magnitude features

2. **Model Training:**
   - Split: 80% train / 20% test
   - GridSearchCV for hyperparameter search
   - Metrics: ROC AUC, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix

3. **Model Saving:**
   - Saved with `joblib`
   - JSON logs created for every run
   - Model files too large for GitHub are excluded

---

## 🚀 Deployment

- Inference API built with **FastAPI**
- Dockerized for consistent deployment
- Use `client.py` to test prediction endpoints

### Example Docker Commands:

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t churn-api .

# Run container
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 churn-api
